			<p>Ever feel like driving a tank? Well, the military probably won't let you, so get the next best thing: a 1988 Jeep Grand Wagoneer. This thing is a beast, with a 5.9-liter V8 under the hood with 144 hp. It only comes with a 3-speed automatic transmission,no overdrive available, this bad boy gets roughly 11 MPG around the city.</br>
			Introduced way back ing 1964, this aging aristocrat has changed very little over the years. Surprisingly, there are a few comforts available in this beast of a road machine. Air conditioning, power windows, and a cassette player all came standard in the 1988 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, though an optional sunroof was available for more daring Jeep owners. The sunroof wasn't powered, though - can't make owning a tank too easy.</p>

			<p>But the most impressive feature of the Grand Wagoneer is its full-time 4wd system. Know as selec-trac, it permits on-the-fly shifting between 2wd, part-time 4wd and full-time 4wd. The transfer case can also engage into low-range, part-time 4wd that allows the drive to go "anywhere".</p>

			<p>I have been an avid Jeeper since the day I could get behind the wheel. My first car when I recieved my license was a Jeep Cherokee. Within the first year of having it, I lifted it and added many other features. Needless to say..."It is a Jeep thing...you would understand" I was hooked with being a Jeep enthusiast.</br>
			This is my first restoration I have done on a car meaning I am a little nervous about what I am getting myself into, but I do think all the hard work and pain will be worth it when the Woody is fully restored.</p>
